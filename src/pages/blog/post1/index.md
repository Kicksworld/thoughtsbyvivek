While walking on street I found one piece of paper. Something was written on it but I didn’t find it meaningful so I crinkled it and threw it in dustbin and started walking again. One person came rushing behind me and asked me “Sir, Did you find any piece of paper around the area?” I was so quick that I said yes it’s there in dustbin. He went near the dustbin and picked that piece of paper and he was relaxed. I went near him and asked, “What is written in that piece of paper”? He was not comfortable to tell me but somehow he managed and murmured “Sir, it’s my mother’s prescription which doctor had given last year. We can not bear expenses to visit doctor every month, so we are keeping this up and managing somehow to get these medicines on time”. I stopped for a while and I realised that the piece of paper is so important for the guy that he could not afford to loose it. Same way we come across many things and are not bothered about them because they are not important or meaningful for us. But somewhere around the world those things might be helpful to other people. Respect everything and every individual because what goes around comes around.
